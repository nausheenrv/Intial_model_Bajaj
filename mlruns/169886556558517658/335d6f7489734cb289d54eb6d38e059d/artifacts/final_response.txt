 The different insurance policies, as outlined in the context, are provided by Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited. There are at least two main types of policies mentioned:

1. Domestic Health Insurance Policy: This policy provides coverage for treatment costs within India, specifically for Imperial and Imperial Plus plans. It offers indemnity based on reasonable and customary expenses with limits, deductibles, terms, conditions, definitions, exclusions, and a one-year tenure. The policy covers various medical treatments like examinations, fillings, crowns, extractions, and surgery related to teeth or structures supporting teeth (dental treatment). Additionally, it includes coverage for emergency care benefits, pre and post hospitalization expenses, room rent, ICU charges, and other benefits subject to the policy terms.

2. Indemnity and Hospital Cash Policies: While specific details about these policies are not provided in this excerpt, they seem to be types of insurance that offer benefits related to treatment costs and cash payouts during hospitalization, respectively. However, it's important to note that the Insurer is not liable for a specified amount or number of days/hours before benefits are payable under these policies, and deductibles do not reduce the Sum Insured.

It's also worth mentioning that if the Insured takes out multiple policies from the same or multiple insurers to cover treatment costs, they have the right to choose which insurer settles their claim. If the amount to be claimed exceeds the Sum Insured under a single policy, the Insured may opt for another insurer for the balance amount. The policy may become void if there is misrepresentation, mis-description, or non-disclosure of any material fact.
